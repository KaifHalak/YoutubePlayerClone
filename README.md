# YouTube Player Clone

This project is a clone of the YouTube player with approximately 75% of the core functionality. The purpose of this project was to practice my React skills.

  - Cinema mode
  - Default mode
  - Full-screen mode
- Videos are played from a local server
- Recommended videos are displayed
- Click on recommended videos to play them
- Currently, the repo contains two videos stored on the server

## How to Install and Run

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repo or download the zip file:
2. Navigate to the project directory. You will find two folders: app (UI) and server.
3. Install dependencies in both folders:
```bash
cd app
npm install

cd server
npm install
```
4. Run the application. You will need to use 2 seperate terminals:
```bash
Terminal 1
cd app
npm run dev

Terminal 2
cd server
npm run server
```
5. Open your browser and go to the provided local URL to access the player interface.

## Notice
- There may be some bugs as the project is not 100% complete. Some small UI features might not work as intended. The goal of this project was not to create a full replica but to practice the use of React.
